1. How can one restrict access to certain columns of a database table?
You can restrict access to specific columns by creating views that only expose the desired columns, and then granting access to the view rather than the entire table.

CREATE VIEW film_public AS
SELECT film_id, title, rating
FROM film;

GRANT SELECT ON film_public TO regular_user;

To ensure that regular_user cannot directly access the film table, we can revoke their permissions on the film table.

REVOKE ALL ON film FROM regular_user;



2. What is the difference between user identification and user authentication?
Identification is the process of recognizing a user, usually through a username or user ID.
Authentication is the process of verifying the user’s identity, typically through a password, biometric data, or an authentication token.

3. What are the recommended authentication protocols for PostgreSQL?
The recommended protocols are SCRAM-SHA-256 for password-based authentication, SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections, Kerberos (GSSAPI) for network-wide authentication, and LDAP for centralized authentication in enterprise environments.

4. What is proxy authentication in PostgreSQL and what is it for? Why does it make the previously discussed role-based access control easier to implement?
Proxy authentication allows an external system (like an application) to authenticate users on behalf of the actual user. This simplifies role-based access control (RBAC) because the application can handle user management, while PostgreSQL assigns roles based on the authenticated user’s identity passed through the proxy.
